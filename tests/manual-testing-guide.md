# Manual Accessibility Testing Guide for Login Form

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive manual testing procedures to verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for the login form. These tests complement automated testing and cover aspects that require human judgment.

## Prerequisites
- Screen reader software (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Various input methods (keyboard, mouse, touch, voice)

## Testing Checklist
