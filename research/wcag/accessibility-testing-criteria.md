# Using Lighthouse CI
lighthouse https://your-site.com/login --only-categories=accessibility
```

## Manual Testing Criteria

### Keyboard Navigation Testing
**Testing Procedure:**
1. Disconnect or disable mouse/trackpad
2. Use only Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, and Arrow keys
3. Navigate through entire login form

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Tab order follows logical visual sequence
- [ ] All interactive elements are reachable via keyboard
- [ ] Focus indicators are clearly visible
- [ ] No keyboard traps (can navigate away from all elements)
- [ ] Enter key submits form from any input field
- [ ] Space key activates buttons and checkboxes
- [ ] Escape key closes modals/dropdowns

### Visual Testing
**Testing Procedure:**
1. Test at various zoom levels (100%, 200%, 400%)
2. Test with high contrast mode enabled
3. Test with custom color schemes

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Content remains readable at 200% zoom
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling at 200% zoom
- [ ] Focus indicators visible at all zoom levels
- [ ] Error messages clearly visible and positioned
- [ ] Color alone not used to convey information
- [ ] Text meets minimum contrast ratios

### Error Handling Testing
**Testing Procedure:**
1. Submit form with empty fields
2. Submit form with invalid data
3. Trigger network/server errors
4. Test correction of errors

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Error messages are specific and actionable
- [ ] Errors announced to screen readers
- [ ] Focus moves to first field with error
- [ ] Error state visually distinct (not just color)
- [ ] Error messages persist until corrected
- [ ] Success messages announced when form submits

## Screen Reader Testing Criteria

### Testing Setup Requirements
**Primary Combinations:**
- NVDA + Chrome on Windows

- VoiceOver + Safari on macOS

### Screen Reader Test Procedure
1. **Navigation Testing**
   - Navigate by headings (H key)
   - Navigate by form elements (F key)
   - Navigate by buttons (B key)
   - Tab through all elements sequentially

2. **Form Interaction Testing**
   - Enter data in each field
   - Trigger validation errors
   - Submit successful form
   - Use form auto-completion features

3. **Announcement Verification**
   - Field labels and requirements announced
   - Error messages read immediately
   - Form submission status communicated
   - Help text associated and announced

### Screen Reader Success Criteria

#### Expected Announcements:
- [ ] **Form entry**: "Login form"
- [ ] **Username field**: "Username or Email, edit, required, type in text"
- [ ] **Password field**: "Password, edit, required, password"  
- [ ] **Error state**: "Invalid entry. Username is required, edit, required"
- [ ] **Submit button**: "Sign In, button"
- [ ] **Success**: "Successfully signed in" or similar confirmation

#### Navigation Requirements:
- [ ] All form elements discoverable via screen reader shortcuts
- [ ] Logical reading order matches visual layout
- [ ] Error messages announced immediately when triggered
- [ ] Help text accessible via browse mode
- [ ] Form boundaries clearly identified

### Screen Reader Testing Script
```
1. Start screen reader (NVDA: Ctrl+Alt+N)
2. Navigate to login form
3. Press H to find form heading
4. Press F to navigate to first form field
5. Enter invalid data and submit
6. Verify error announcements
7. Correct errors and submit successfully
8. Verify success announcements
```

## Performance Testing Criteria

### Loading and Responsiveness
- [ ] Form renders within 3 seconds
