# Responsive Pricing Table - System Architecture

## Architecture Decision Record (ADR-001)

### Status: Approved
### Date: 2025-08-29
### Architect: System Architecture Designer

## Context
We need to design a responsive pricing table component that works across all device sizes, uses CSS custom properties for theming, and provides mobile collapse functionality while maintaining accessibility and performance.

## Decision
We will implement a modular, component-based architecture using:
- Semantic HTML structure with proper ARIA roles
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Mobile-first responsive design with progressive enhancement
- JavaScript for enhanced interactions while maintaining no-JS fallback
- Modular file structure for maintainability

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Maintainable, scalable, accessible, and performant solution
- **Negative**: Slightly more complex initial setup compared to monolithic approach
- **Risks**: Browser compatibility for CSS custom properties (IE11+)

## Quality Attributes

### Primary
- **Responsiveness**: Adapts seamlessly across all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- **Maintainability**: Modular, well-documented code structure
- **Performance**: Fast loading, minimal JavaScript dependencies

### Secondary
- **Scalability**: Easy to add/remove pricing tiers
- **Customizability**: Theme-able via CSS custom properties
- **Robustness**: Graceful degradation without JavaScript

## Constraints
- Must work without JavaScript (progressive enhancement)
- Support modern browsers (IE11+ for CSS custom properties)
- Mobile-first approach required
- Semantic HTML for screen readers

## Assumptions
- Users will primarily interact on mobile and desktop
- Pricing data is static or updated infrequently
- Component will be integrated into existing design system

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. PricingTable (Container)
- **Role**: Main container and coordinator
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manages overall layout
  - Handles responsive breakpoints
  - Coordinates mobile collapse state
  - Provides CSS custom property context

#### 2. PricingTier (Individual Plan)
- **Role**: Single pricing plan representation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Displays plan details (name, price, features)
  - Handles tier-specific styling
  - Manages featured/highlighted state
  - Provides accessible content structure

#### 3. PricingFeatures (Feature List)
- **Role**: Feature comparison display
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Lists plan features
  - Handles feature availability states
  - Provides accessible feature descriptions
  - Manages feature highlighting/tooltips

#### 4. MobileController (Collapse Handler)
- **Role**: Mobile interaction management
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manages accordion/tabs for mobile
  - Handles smooth transitions
  - Maintains accessible focus management
  - Provides keyboard navigation

## Technical Specifications

### HTML Semantic Structure
- Use `<table>` for feature comparison grid
- Use `<article>` for individual pricing tiers
- Use `<section>` for logical groupings
- Implement proper ARIA roles and labels
- Include skip links for keyboard navigation

### CSS Custom Properties Strategy
- Namespace all variables with `--pricing-`
- Organize by category (colors, spacing, typography)
- Provide light/dark theme variants
- Enable runtime theme switching

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320px - 767px (stacked layout)
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px (2-column grid)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (horizontal comparison)

### JavaScript Enhancement Patterns
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Event delegation for performance
- Module pattern for organization
- Intersection Observer for animations
