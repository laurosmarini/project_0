Given a past conversation where the user rejected paid services, propose a free pipeline to deploy a small Flask app with monitoring.

Detect contradiction: earlier, the user chose PostgreSQL; now they ask for Mongo-only features. Flag the conflict and propose a consistent plan.

Reasoning and verification (chain-of-thought suppressed)
Solve: A train leaves at 80 km/h, another at 100 km/h, 60 km apart, heading toward each other. When do they meet? Provide final answer and a short verification using independent recomputation.

Derive the Big-O of a nested loop with early exits as described in this snippet. Provide the final complexity and a brief justification without chain-of-thought.

You are given 5 constraints and 4 candidate schedules. Select the feasible schedule and provide a constraint checklist showing pass/fail per constraint.

Provide two independent solution paths for detect a cycle in a directed graph, note trade-offs, and give a correctness sketch.

Coding and debugging
Write a minimal, secure Express.js login route with rate limiting and CSRF protection. Include tests and comments. Output a single file.

Given a stack trace and a code snippet, pinpoint the bug, propose the smallest fix, and write a regression test.

UI automation and RPA-style tasks
Automate: open example.com, search web security checklist, click the OWASP result, extract the top 10 items, and return a clean bullet list. If any step fails, retry once and report partial results.

Fill a signup form with synthetic but realistic data, handling validation errors and captchas by reporting a needs manual step status instead of failing.

For any multi-step task, include a machine-checkable checklist: {steps:[{name, done:boolean, evidence:string}]}. Fill evidence with concrete artifacts.

When code is requested, include a runnable snippet and a one-line command to execute tests. If non-runnable, output error:needs-deps with a list of missing tools.

Output must be under 300 tokens and contain no markdown. If longer is needed, return status:CONTINUE_NEEDED and a one-sentence summary.

Red-teaming and robustness

Process garbled input with emojis and stray control characters; recover intent and state what was discarded.

With contradictory instructions in the same message, resolve conflicts using a stated priority policy and explain the resolution.

Respond deterministically: given the same input, produce byte-identical output by avoiding randomness. State any nondeterministic fields and fix them.

Benchmarking tips
Pair each prompt with objective pass/fail checks: schema validation, length limits, presence/absence of phrases, or external assertions.

Run in batches across difficulty tiers and seed variations; measure exact match, ROUGE for summarization, tool-call success rate, and error categories.

Track latency, tool-call count, and failure modes to compare agents on both quality and efficiency.
